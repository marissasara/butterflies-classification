# Butterfly Images Classification with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Description
This repository contains a comprehensive analysis of butterfly species classification using various convolutional neural network (CNN) models. It is part of the project for the Principles of Artificial Intelligence subject, focusing on model performance evaluation and improvement strategies.Detailed analysis of confusion matrices, training accuracy, and loss trends are included to provide comprehensive insights.

## Overview

Butterfly species classification is a challenging task due to the subtle visual differences between species. This project employs three popular neural network architectures—ResNet50, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV3Small—to tackle this classification problem. The goal is to analyze their performance, identify areas for improvement, and suggest enhancements.
